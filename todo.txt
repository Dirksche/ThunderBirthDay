* calIItemBase.id
	- At the moment, it's a random number between 0 and 1000.
	- What is it for?
	- How can we find a certain addressbook card with a given ID?
		--> implementation of calThunderBirthDay.getItem()
* calIItemBase.recurrenceId
	- What is it for?
	- What's the difference to calIItemBase.recurrenceStartDate?
* calIItemBase.createProxy
	- Not sure whether we should use this instead of clonig the parentItem...
	- Is cTBD_getOccurencesAsEvents the correct way to return occurrences?
* I'm sure there's a lot more. Anyway, if you read this and have any
  ideas, suggestions, critics or whatsoever, please let me know!
