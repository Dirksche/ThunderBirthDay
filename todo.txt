* calIItemBase.id
	- At the moment, it's a random number between 0 and 1000.
	- What is it for? How long is one ID assossiated with its
	  event? Does this assossiation end with the termination of
	  Thunderbird or does one event have to have the same ID every
	  time Thunderbird starts?
	- How can we find a certain addressbook card with a given ID?
		--> implementation of calThunderBirthDay.getItem()
	- When is the getItem() function used anyway?

* calIItemBase.recurrenceId
	- What is it for?
	- What's the difference to calIItemBase.recurrenceStartDate?

* calIItemBase.createProxy
	- Not sure whether we should use this instead of clonig the parentItem...
	- Is cTBD_getOccurencesAsEvents the correct way to return occurrences?

* I'm sure there's a lot more. Anyway, if you read this and have any
  ideas, suggestions, critics or whatsoever, please let me know!
